## LensCrafte Web - About Cameras

* This website is a showcase of my CSS skills, and it is made entirely using HTML and CSS. It features a gallery of camera images, an event calendar, a store where people can purchase cameras, and a contact and feedback form. The website is simple to run, and it only requires a live server.
